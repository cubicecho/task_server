 * On-demand tool loading.
 *
 * A full tool definition is mostly JSON Schema, and it is sent on every request of every
 * iteration whether or not the model wants it — a couple of connected servers can cost more
 * tokens per request than the task's own prompt. So in on-demand mode the run starts with a
 * bare *catalogue*: tool names only, appended to the system prompt, plus this one meta-tool.
 * The model calls `load_tools` with what it needs, and the next round trip carries those real
 * definitions.
 *
 * Names alone cost roughly a fortieth of what the schemas cost, so a run that needs no tools
 * pays almost nothing, and a run that needs three pays for three.
