/**
 * Two surfaces side by side, as equals.
 *
 * The slots are numbered rather than named for a role or a side, because neither survives what
 * this component already does. A role pair (`content`/`sidebar`) is a lie about a genuinely even
 * split, and a side pair (`left`/`right`) is a lie below `stackBelow`, where the panes are above
 * and below, and again under RTL. `first` and `second` are true in every one of those: first in
 * reading order, wherever reading is going.
 *
 * {@link SidebarLayout} is this component with the roles put back, for the common case where one
 * pane is the screen and the other is beside it.
 *
 * The floors are the reason this is a component rather than a class string. A grid cell's
 * `min-width` is `auto`, so one wide child — a table, a long unbroken string — grows its track
 * and pushes the other pane off the screen instead of scrolling inside its own. `min-h-0` /
 * `min-w-0` on both cells is what makes a nested scroll container work at all, and it is the same
 * failure `HeaderContentFooter` guards in the other axis: there a wide child pushes the
 * chrome out of the column, here it pushes the neighbouring pane out of the row. Half the panes
 * this replaces are missing one or both.
 *
 * **It is not resizable, and that is a decision rather than a gap.** A draggable divider needs a
 * pointer handler and a stored width, and a stored width is state, which rule 8 keeps out of a
 * shell. The two ways to keep it out both fail on their own terms: expressing the drag in CSS
 * (`resize: horizontal`) gives a handle only a mouse can reach, and lifting the width out to
 * `firstWidth`/`onFirstWidthChange` still leaves the drag itself — behaviour — in here, to be
 * re-derived worse than `react-resizable-panels`, which shadcn already ships as `resizable`.
 * Rule 3 says do not wrap what shadcn ships; this is its other half, do not rebuild it either. A
 * screen that genuinely needs a draggable split is a screen for that primitive. None of the
 * eleven call sites this replaces has one.
 *
 * Because nothing drags, the divider is a rule and not a control: `aria-hidden`, no role, no tab
 * stop. A focus stop that does nothing when you press an arrow key is worse than no focus stop —
 * axe is satisfied and the keyboard user is standing in a dead end. The contrast is
 * `HeaderContentFooter`'s scrolling body, which takes a tab stop precisely because it
 * *does* something once you are there. Scrolling stays there too: a pane that needs to scroll is
 * a `StickyHeaderContentFooter` passed as `first` or `second`, so this shell adds no scroll
 * container of its own and no keyboard trap to go with it.
 *
 * **A collapsed pane is an absent one.** Every second pane eventually wants to close, and the
 * whole of that is `second={open ? nav : undefined}` — the caller already holds the toggle, and
 * the un-split layout is the full-width column that was needed anyway for the inspector with
 * nothing selected. A `collapsed` prop would buy a second way to say it and a piece of state to
 * keep in step with the first.
 *
 * **No `loading`.** `CardLayout` has one because a card has a single body and a precedence to
 * own (`loading` outranks `empty`). A split has neither: it has two panes that arrive at
 * different times, and one boolean across both has to either skeleton a pane that was never
 * waiting or pick one, which is a second prop. The prior art shows the failure directly — the
 * layout this is drawn from had a `loading` that replaced the entire chassis with a bare
 * skeleton, so chrome already on the screen blinked out and came back. Each pane's content owns
 * its own loading state, and a pane that is a `CardLayout` already has the word for it.
 *
 * **Horizontal only.** Stacking below `stackBelow` is the vertical arrangement, and a split that
 * is vertical at every width is two zones in a column with floors between them — which is
 * `HeaderContentFooter`, already. A vertical orientation here would be rule 7's exact bug:
 * a second implementation of a shape another shell owns.
