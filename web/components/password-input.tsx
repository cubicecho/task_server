/**
 * A password box with an eye on it.
 *
 * Nine call sites across six projects write `<Input type="password">`, and not one of them can be
 * un-masked. Five of those are token gates — a pasted bearer token, a server's start-up secret —
 * where the only failure mode is a character that went in wrong and the only diagnosis is
 * "Unlock" not working. The other four are a change-password form, which asks for the same secret
 * twice precisely because it cannot be read back.
 *
 * So the control is the toggle, and everything else is shadcn's `Input` unchanged. Three details
 * are the ones a hand-written eye gets wrong, every time:
 *
 * - **`type="button"`.** A `<button>` in a `<form>` submits by default, so a reveal written
 *   without it submits the login form on the way to reading the password.
 * - **The button is named, and the name changes.** An icon-only button with no `aria-label` is an
 *   axe failure and a screen reader saying "button"; one whose label stays "Show password" after
 *   it has shown it is worse, because it is confidently wrong.
 * - **The masking is the `type`, not a CSS trick.** `type="text"` while revealed is what stops
 *   the password manager from filling the field a second time and what keeps the value out of the
 *   browser's own "reveal" chrome on Edge, which would otherwise draw a second eye beside this
 *   one.
 *
 * Revealed state is deliberately local and deliberately not a prop. Nothing above this needs to
 * know, and a form that persisted it would be a form that remembers to show a password.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <PasswordInput id="token" autoComplete="current-password" value={token} onChange={…} />
 * ```
