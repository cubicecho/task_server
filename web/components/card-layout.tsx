 * A card with its slots already placed.

 * The shape is the one every card in these apps arrives at on its own — an icon and a title, a
 * line of description under it, an action at the far end of the header, a body, and a footer
 * that holds the buttons — and writing it out each time is how they drift: some put the action
 * beside the title and some under it, some give the description a `text-sm` and some a `text-xs`,
 * and a card with nothing to show says so in a different voice on every screen.
 *
 * Every slot is a node, `content` included, so a card is one element at the call site and the
 * question "where does this go?" has one answer per prop. `empty` and `loading` are the two that
 * are not slots the caller places: they are what the body says when the data came back empty, and
 * while it has not come back at all. A list rendered from a `map` reaches the first state on its
 * own the moment its array is empty.
