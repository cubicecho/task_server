 * A select taking a list of options, rather than seven primitives to assemble.

 * and a bound field wrapping it. Select shipped once, as `SelectField`, so the only way to get
 * one was through a TanStack form: a filter bar, a search box or a `useState` screen had to
 * hand-write the trigger, the value, the content and the mapped items, and there are ten of
 * those across these projects.
 *
 * They are hand-written wrong in the same place every time. **Radix's `Select` root renders no
 * DOM**, so an `id` or an `aria-invalid` put on it goes nowhere; both belong on the trigger.
 * Which is why this takes the rest of a `<button>`'s props and spreads them there — the shape
 * `FormField`'s function form hands its control, so this drops into one without a wrapper:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <FormField
 *   label="Kind"
 *   control={(wired) => (
 *     <Select {...wired} options={KINDS} value={kind} onValueChange={setKind} />
 *   )}
 * />
 * ```
 *
 * **This is not shadcn's `Select`.** That one is the primitive at `ui/select` and takes children;
 * this one takes `options`. Both are called Select because both are a select, and the import
 * path is what tells them apart — the mistake is loud, since the props do not typecheck against
 * each other.
