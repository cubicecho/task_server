/**
 * A button whose reason can always be read — including when it cannot be pressed.
 *
 * Two bugs, and the second is the one worth the file.
 *
 * **It has a name.** See {@link ActionButtonProps.label}.
 *
 * **Its reason survives being disabled.** These apps are full of `title="Empty the lane first"`
 * on controls disabled for exactly that reason, and shadcn's `Button` sets
 * `disabled:pointer-events-none`: the browser never fires the hover, so the one explanation a
 * person needed is the one they cannot get. A `disabled` button is also out of the tab order
 * entirely, so a keyboard user cannot reach the answer by any route at all — the control is
 * simultaneously refusing and mute.
 *
 * So `disabled` here is `aria-disabled` instead. The control keeps its focus ring, its hover and
 * its tooltip, the press is refused in the handler, and assistive technology reads it as
 * unavailable either way. Pass `hint` and the tooltip says why.
 *
 * **Its reason is not only visual.** A tooltip's text exists in the DOM only while the tooltip
 * is open — Radix unmounts the content on close — so a `hint` that lives only there is a thing
 * you can see and cannot hear: the button announces "Delete workspace" and stops, and the
 * sentence explaining that it is refused, or what it takes with it, is never read. It is worst
 * in exactly the case the prop is for, because a person who cannot see the button is the one
 * who cannot hover it either.
 *
 * So `hint` is also rendered into an `sr-only` span that is always mounted, and the button
 * points at it with `aria-describedby`. That covers the closed tooltip and one more case: Radix
 * closes a tooltip when its trigger is scrolled into view by focus, which is precisely how a
 * keyboard user arrives at one.
 *
 * The description wins over the one Radix sets while open — `Slot` lets the child's props
 * override the trigger's — so the hint is announced once, from the same text, open or closed.
 *
 * **The provider.** shadcn's `Tooltip` needs a `TooltipProvider` above it and throws without
 * one, so this renders its own — a component installed from a registry cannot assume the app it
 * lands in has already put one at the root. Radix nests providers happily.
 *
 * What nesting does *not* do is merge. A provider replaces the one above it for everything below,
 * so an app whose root is `<TooltipProvider delayDuration={300}>` gets 300ms everywhere except on
 * these buttons, which take shadcn's provider default of `0` and open the instant the pointer
 * crosses them. On a toolbar of them that reads as a flicker while every other control on the
 * screen waits. `skipDelayDuration` is lost the same way: grouping spans one provider, and this
 * one contains a single button, so moving along a row re-waits at each.
 *
 * Both are therefore props here, forwarded to the provider this renders. `delayDuration={300}`
 * matches an app's root; a wrapper that passes it once is how a project says it in one place.
 *
 * There is no inheriting the root's value automatically: Radix exposes no way to ask whether a
 * provider is already above you, so the button cannot render one only when it is needed, and
 * cannot read what the outer one was set to. Leaving these unset keeps shadcn's `0` rather than
 * finding the app's number.
