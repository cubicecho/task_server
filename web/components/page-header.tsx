/**
 * How each heading level is drawn.
 *
 * The level is a prop rather than a hardcoded tag because this block is the same shape at three
 * depths and only the caller knows which one it is in: `<h1>` is right for the page it names and
 * wrong inside a card that already sits under one, and `<h2>` is the reverse. A shell that picks
 * for you is wrong on half the screens, and a shell that takes `title={<h1 className="…">…}` has
 * handed the size back to the caller — which is the drift, not the fix. The same page `<h1>` is
 * `text-lg`, `text-xl`, `text-2xl` and `text-3xl` in four of these projects, and two headers in
 * *one* project disagree with each other. This map is what ends that.
 *
 * - `row` is the floor under the title row. It holds the row to one height whether or not the
 *   page has an action and whether or not it has a description, so `content` beneath it starts
 *   at the same place on every page.
 * - `bar` is the height of one line of `title`, so a loading header is exactly as tall as the
 *   header it becomes.
 *
 * A literal map, per rule 3 — every class here is a class Tailwind can find in this file.

   * The jump is real and it is invisible on a warm cache: one detail page in these apps replaces

   * a heading, a back button and two buttons, and everything below it moves.

   * A caller wanting its own placeholder passes it as `title`, which is a node, and leaves this

/**
 * The title block a page wears in a header slot.
 *
 * Every list page in these apps writes this out: a name, a line under it, the page's buttons at
 * the far end, and a search or filter row beneath. Written out each time, they disagree about
 * all of it — the same `<h1>` is four different sizes across four projects and two different
 * sizes inside one of them, it is `font-semibold` in three and `font-bold` in the fourth, the
 * description truncates on the detail pages and wraps everywhere else, and "what happens to a
 * long title next to three buttons" has four answers, one of which is "nothing".
 *
 * **The padding seam.** {@link HeaderContentFooter} deliberately leaves its header slot unpadded
 * and gives the body `px-4`, because the page header carries its own inset — this component is
 * the one that comment means. So the inset lives here, exactly once, and the two edges line up
 * beneath a `width="page"` chassis.
 *
 * The other model, where a `<main>` owns the inset and the header inherits it, is what the rest
 * of these apps do, and it is why one route in one of them is inset 12px while every other page
 * is 16px: the page shell merged a caller's `className` over its own padding and nobody saw.
 * Dropped into a chassis that already pads, this header passes `className="px-0"` and the seam
 * stays owned by exactly one of the two.
 *
 * The *cap* does not live here. The prior art applied `PAGE_COLUMN` in both places so a header
 * dropped somewhere else still read as a page header, but that makes a header inside a
 * `width="full"` chassis cap itself while the body under it does not — the header contradicting
 * the chassis it was handed. The chassis owns the column, the header owns the inset, and each
 * seam is decided in one file.
 *
 * **Narrow widths.** The title row wraps rather than stacking at a breakpoint: the title block
 * asks for 16rem, and when that plus the action will not fit on one line, the action drops to
 * its own. A breakpoint is the wrong instrument, because the variable is how wide the *action*
 * is, not how wide the window is — one header here has a search field and two buttons in its
 * action and was squeezing its title at 1100px, which no phone breakpoint would have caught,
 * and another is a pane inside a split, narrow on a wide screen.
 *
 * The title wraps; it does not truncate. A card title truncates because it is one of many on a
 * screen that gives it context — a page title *is* the context, and half of one names nothing.
