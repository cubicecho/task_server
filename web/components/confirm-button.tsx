/**
 * A button that asks first.
 *
 * There are 22 hand-written `<AlertDialogContent>` blocks across these projects and four of them
 * are already this component, extracted independently — `kanban_server/.../confirm-button.tsx`,
 * `eunomia/.../confirm-delete.tsx`, a private project's `confirm.tsx`, and `philotes`, which wrote
 * it inline twice. The other twelve are loose in route files. They disagree about the button
 * order, about whether the confirm is `variant="destructive"` or a `cn(buttonVariants(…))`
 * (`AlertDialogAction` takes `variant` now, so the second spelling is only ever a leftover), and
 * about what Cancel is called.
 *
 * **`description` is required, and that is the opinion this component is carrying.** It is meant
 * to say what is lost, not to ask again. "This action cannot be undone" is what the dialog
 * already implies and it is what nine of these call sites say; "the lane takes its cards with
 * it" is the thing the person did not know and could not have guessed from the row they clicked.
 * A confirm whose description is the word "permanently" has cost a click and taught nothing. The
 * prop is required because the useful sentence is the one that gets skipped when it is optional.
 *
 * **Why the open state rather than `AlertDialogTrigger asChild`.** The trigger is an
 * {@link ActionButton}, which is already a `TooltipTrigger asChild`, and two `Slot`s over one
 * button fight over the ref and the handlers. Holding `open` here is four lines and it keeps the
 * button's tooltip, its name and its `aria-disabled` intact.
 *
 * Destructive only, deliberately. `confirmLabel` reaches Discard, Revoke, Remove and Reset — a
 * confirm that is *not* destructive is a question, and a question is `DialogLayout`.
