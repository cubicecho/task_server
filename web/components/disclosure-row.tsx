/**
 * One row in a list of things you can open: a run, a task, an archived record.
 *
 * The row itself is `Item`, so a row that opens and a row that does not line up down to the
 * padding. What this adds is the opening, and it is here rather than left to each app because
 * the parts of a disclosure that go wrong are the small ones:
 *
 * - **The whole heading is one `<button>`**, so the row is reachable by keyboard and works with
 *   Space — not a chevron with a click handler, which is the version hand-written rows ship.
 * - `aria-expanded` on that button, so the state is announced rather than only drawn as a
 *   rotated chevron.
 * - The chevron turns off the same boolean, so there is one source of truth for open.
 * - **`action` sits outside the button.** A control nested inside a button is invalid HTML and,
 *   in practice, a delete button that cannot be clicked. Three pages of one app were laid out
 *   this way after finding that out.
 *
 * It is not a prop on `Item`: an `open`/`onOpenChange` pair there would turn every existing
 * caller's heading into a button, which is a different element and a different contract.
 *
 * Open is controlled, because in these apps a row is often opened from somewhere else — a deep
 * link to a run, a "show the failure" button further up the page. An uncontrolled default would
 * be a convenience worth adding, not the base case.
