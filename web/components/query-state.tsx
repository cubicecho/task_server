/**
 * The three things a list of rows can be before it is a list of rows.
 *
 * Every list page in every one of these apps opens the same way — the request failed, or it has
 * not landed, or it landed empty, or draw the rows — and every one of them writes that ladder
 * out again. The rung that goes wrong is the last one, because it has two correct spellings:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * data?.roles.length === 0                        // read straight off the query
 * shown.length === 0 && !isPending && !isError    // already defaulted to []
 * ```
 *
 * Six pages in one app, in both spellings, and neither is a bug — which is exactly why nobody
 * ever consolidated them. Here the three rungs are exclusive by construction, and the page says
 * what it is about to draw rather than the guard working it out again.
 *
 * It returns `null` once there are rows, so a page reads as the ladder and then the list:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <QueryState query={roles} what="your roles" count={shown.length} empty={<Empty … />} />
 * {shown.map(…)}
 * ```
 *
 * `query` is taken structurally rather than as a TanStack `UseQueryResult` — the same line
 * `FormField` holds against form libraries. A shell that names one data library is a shell the
 * next app cannot install.
