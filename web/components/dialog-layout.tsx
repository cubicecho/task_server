/**
 * A dialog with its slots already placed, and a body that scrolls under a header that does not.
 *
 * The scroll is the reason this exists rather than a snippet. Every hand-written dialog in these
 * apps caps itself with `max-h-[85vh] overflow-y-auto` on the content, which scrolls the *whole*
 * dialog: on a long form the title leaves the screen first and the save button is somewhere past
 * the end of the fields.
 *
 * That shape — chrome that stays, a middle that moves, floors that let it — is
 * {@link HeaderContentFooter}, so the dialog composes it rather than owning a second copy. What
 * is left here is the part that is about dialogs: the primitive's own header and footer, the
 * title an assistive technology needs, and the two classes that turn `DialogContent` into a
 * column that can be divided.
 *
 * **`hasUnsavedChanges` is a prop and not a hook, and that is the whole point.** Seven dialogs in
 * kanban_server closed through a `useDiscardGuard`; six called it and the seventh wired
 * `onOpenChange` straight into its `onClose` and quietly lost what had been typed. A hook is a
 * thing a caller can forget. A shell is not, because a caller cannot see it.
 *
 * **Padding stays with the primitive.** `DialogContent` carries it (`p-6` in new-york, `p-4` in
 * others) and so do the footers that bleed to its edge with a negative margin. A shell that set
 * its own would be a shell that only fits one style, so this one overrides `display` and
 * `overflow` and nothing else.
