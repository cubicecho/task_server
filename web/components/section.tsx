/**
 * A heading over a group of fields or rows.
 *
 * The smallest thing in this registry, and it is here because it is the one three projects wrote
 * separately and got *almost* the same: `text-xs font-semibold uppercase` and a muted foreground
 * in all three, then `tracking-wider` in one and `tracking-wide` in another, and a `border-b pb-1`
 * in the third. Nobody copied anybody — they each typed the same five tokens from memory, which
 * is why the sixth is different. That is the failure mode a shared token has no answer for, since
 * the value being retyped *is* a class list.
 *
 * It draws no surface. Philotes wraps its sections in a `Card` and the other two do not, so the
 * card stays a decision at the call site — this is a label and a gap, and `CardLayout` is the one
 * that owns a border and a padding box. It is also not `PageHeader`: that is the single `h1` at
 * the top of a route, and there are many of these per screen.
 *
 * No state, no data, no `children` — the body is `content`, like every other shell here.
