 * outside-click `useEffect`, no portal, no keyboard navigation, and `aria-haspopup="listbox"` on
 * a button with no listbox anywhere beneath it; the third is a stack of checkboxes. The middle
 * one is the one that matters, because it looks like a combobox and is not operable as one — it
 * cannot be opened, moved through or chosen from without a mouse.
 *
 * So this is the first shape, kept: a real `Popover` (portalled, focus-trapped, closes on Escape
 * and on outside click without anyone writing the listener) over cmdk, which owns the roving
 * focus and the typeahead.
 *
 * **Clearing is in the footer, not on the trigger.** The obvious place for an `X` is inside the
 * trigger, and the trigger is a `<button>` — a button inside a button is not valid HTML and the
 * inner one is unreachable by keyboard in every browser. Chips get their own remove buttons only
 * when they are outside the trigger, which they are not here, so the footer holds the one Clear.
